Deques 
or double ended queues are list-like objects that upport thread-safe, memory-efficient appends.They are mutable and support some of the operations on lists e,g indexing, 
The major advantage of deques over lists is that inserting items at the begining of a deque is much faster than at the begining if a list although inserting at the end is slower than in lists.
