Principle of ALgorithim Design 
Reasons to study algorithims 
-They are essential for computer science and intelligent systems.
-They are important in many other domains (computational biology, economics, ecology, communications, ecology, physics, and so on)
-They play a role in technology innovation.
-They improve problem solving and analytical thinking.

Recursion can often achieve the same result as iteration, however, they are fundamentally different. A recursive function calls itself, applying the same function to progressively smaller inputs.The input of any recursive step is the output of the previous recursive step.

--- ALgorithims are composed of 4 elements 
-Sequential operations 
-Actions based on the state of a data struscture
-Iteration, repeating an action a number of times 
-Recursion,calling itself on a subset of inputs 

--- Algorithim design paridigms
Divide and conquer- break down the problem solve it the merge it latter on
Greedy algorithims -finding the best solution to a local problem in the hope taht it will lead to a global solution 
Dynamic programming-uses recursion result of operations cached to be used in subsequent operations .Unlike divide and conquer dynamic allows us to compare results at different stages. This can have a perfomance advantage over divide and conquer because it is quicker to retrieve a previous calculation than recalculating it.
