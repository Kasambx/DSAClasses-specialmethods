CounterObjects
is a subclass of a dictionary where each dict key is hashable and associated with the einteger count of the object.

we can create an empty container and populate it using update method eg
counter('anysequence')
returns Counter({'e': 3, 'n': 2, 'a': 1, 'y': 1, 's': 1, 'q': 1, 'u': 1, 'c': 1})


The most notable difference btwn counter objects and dicts is that counter objects return zero counts dicts retun key error.

we can creae an iterator out of a counter objects by using its elements() method this returns an iterator that counts below one are not included and the order is not guaranteed. Thoughh you can use sorted().
