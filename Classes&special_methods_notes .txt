Classes in python 
is a way to create new objects .It defines a set of attributes that are shared across instances of that class .Classes are sets of functions, variables, and properties
The functions defined inside a class are called instance methods
They apply some operations to the class instance by passing an
instance of that class as the first argument. This argument is called self by convention, but
it can be any legal identifier. example in the .py file:

Class variables, such as numEmployee, share values among all the instances of the class. In
this example, numEmployee is used to count the number of employee instances. Note that
the Employee class implements the __init__ and __del__ special methods, which we
will discuss in the next section.

We can create instances of the Employee objects, run methods, and return class and
instance variables by doing the following:

Special methods
n/b- The only special method we actually call in our programs, as
common practice, is the __init__ method, to invoke the initializer of the superclass in our
own class definitions
